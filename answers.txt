What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Population Size: 100,000
Vaccination Percentage: 90%
Virus Name: Ebola
Mortality Rate: 70%
Reproduction Rate: 25%
People Initially Infected: 10
--
What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
Total Infected: 10832  about 10.83% of the population
--
What percentage of the population died from the virus?
Total Dead: 6338 about 6.34%
--
Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
212,385 vaccinated interactions saved people. It's pretty insane.
